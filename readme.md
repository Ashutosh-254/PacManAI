## Advanced Pacman Game

This repository hosts the Advanced Pacman Game. The goal was to recreate the classic arcade game with additional features and improved gameplay dynamics.

## Algorithms and Concepts

- **Enhanced Ghost AI:** Implementation of complex algorithms to simulate intelligent ghost behaviors.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** Studied and implemented to enhance ghost movements. Examples include A* and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
- **State Machines:** Used for managing game states and transitions between different game phases.
- **Game Loop Architecture:** Explored the fundamental structure of game loops including event processing, game state updating, and render sequencing.
- **Collision Detection:** Implemented methods to handle collisions between game entities (e.g., Pacman and ghosts).
